# WMH
A database of MRI images of subjects with WMH. Given the limitation of upload file size, we compressed these data into 41 zip format files, and each zip format file comprised MR data of 3 to 5 subjects. The files of WMH (1)-WMH (20) were data containing the segmentation maps generated by two observers, and the WMH 21-WMH 41 are subjects with raw MR data.The details of each file are illustrated as follows
1)In data of each subject, the files of _regt1_rmskull.nii.gz, _regt1_rmskull.nii.gz and _t2flair_rmskull.nii.gz are referred to the images of T1WI, T2WI and FLAIR, respectively. 
2)In the data containing the segmentation maps, the files of _cerAndUncer_rmskull.nii.gz exhibit the “certain” (the areas that were judged as WMH by the both two observers, shown in red) and the “uncertain” WMH (the areas that were considered as WMH by only one observer, shown in blue) of a subject generated from two observers. 
3)The files of _union_rmskull.nii.gz exhibit the union of WMH and other intracranial lesions generated by the two observers. WMH are represented in red and other intracranial lesions are shown in green.
4)The files of _WMH1_union_rmskull_onlyWMHlabel.nii.gz exhibit the union of WMH generated by the two observers, without showing the segmentation of other intracranial lesions.
